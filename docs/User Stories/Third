As a logged in user, who logged in using the methods specified in the first step, I want to plan what breweries I want to visit before games this year, so 
I select some breweries to add to my to-visit list. The next time the user searches for a game, the website will check the userâ€™s to-visit list and 
recommend the closest breweries on that list first, and then the nearby breweries. This will allow users to visit their favorite breweries as well as 
being recommended new ones.
