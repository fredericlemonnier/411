I’m a user in my 20s attending a soccer game with my friends. We’re discussing what to do after the game, and someone suggests going to a brewery. 
We’re not familiar with this part of the city, and we don’t know any good spots nearby. Good thing my school friends designed a program for this purpose!
As a logged in user (I log in via Google), it’s easy for me to enter the team and date, and a bunch of options pop up for me. We have several choices, and 
end up going to multiple breweries. This program makes my life easier.
