Soccer Match Brewery Finder
The idea is that the user inputs a soccer game they are attending and in return gets breweries close to the stadium. We will use the https://www.api-football.com/coverage or https://docs.sportmonks.com/football2/getting-started/welcome api for the soccer games and the https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation api to find the breweries.

Recipe Finder and Calorie Calculator
The idea is that the user inputs the current ingredients they have and in return gets the possible recipes and their calorie information. We will use three potential APIs: spoonacular API:
https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition/ 
Edamam API:
https://rapidapi.com/edamam/api/recipe-search-and-diet/ 
Recipe ingredients extractor API:
https://rapidapi.com/c85270r/api/recipe-ingredients-extractor/
