1. Soccer Match Brewery Finder
The idea is that the user inputs a soccer game they are attending and in return gets breweries close to the stadium. 
We will use the "https://www.api-football.com/coverage or https://docs.sportmonks.com/football2/getting-started/welcome api" for the soccer games 
and the "https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation" api to find the breweries.

2. Food recipe and nutrition analysis app proposal:
  Our app is a meal management app, which offers two functionalities: 1)providing food recipes according to the user's needs has and 2)tracking the nutrition and calories consumption of the user. 
  Our app first starts with searching for the recipes for the users according to their needs. 
We’ll use the “Spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and food API” to display the corresponding food recipes for our app users according to the search filters they use.
In this recipe search API, there are many filters to choose from, such as ingredients and equipment you currently have, the desired cuisine type, your standard for the minCalories and maxCalories and so on.
  Our app will be a tailored food and recipe management app for our users. 
  In the user’s recipe search, we’ll not only provide the recipe itself but also detailed instructions of how to cook that meal step by step. 
  A second part of our app is nutrition analysis.
  Whenever the user selects a recipe as his or her meal, our app will keep track of the calories and nutritions contained in that recipe and generate charts to display the calories and nutritions contained within that meal. 
  Our app will also build a weekly dashboard as a report to show the distribution of calories and nutrients consumed by the user each day, and our app will also provide tailored meal prep suggestions according to the user’s recipe search records. 
  For example, if the records show that the user only eats high calorie food such as pizza and pizza and lack nutrients like Vitamin C, we’ll provide suggestions for the user to eat more vegetable salads.  
  Another API we could possibly use is called Edamam API. We’ll use this API to do nutrition analysis for our users.  
  Recipe ingredients extractor API is another API we will use. This API extracts recipe data (ingredients, units, instructions, images, times…) from a recipe URL, which could serve for searching the detailed step-by-step instructions of a specific recipe.
